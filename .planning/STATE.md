# Project State

## Project Reference

See: .planning/PROJECT.md (updated 2026-07-30)

**Core value:** The pit sees what the car is doing while it is doing it, and no run's data is ever lost.
**Current focus:** Phase 0 — Compression Ratio Gate

## Current Position

Phase: 0 of 10 (Compression Ratio Gate)
Plan: 0 of TBD in current phase
Status: Ready to plan
Last activity: 2026-07-30 — Roadmap created; 57 v1 requirements mapped across 10 phases

Progress: [░░░░░░░░░░] 0%

## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- [Roadmap]: Compression ratio is a go/no-go gate (Phase 0), measured offline against an existing log before any transport/framing layout is committed.
- [Roadmap]: Archive path and thin live link ship together in Phase 1 — they share the capture fan-out and neither proves anything alone.
- [Roadmap]: Radio integration is isolated in Phase 9 with zero v1 requirements, so unpurchased RFD900x hardware can slip without blocking any other phase.
- [Roadmap]: Ground station is Python end to end; the Node server is retired in Phase 2 once the Python process serves the dashboard.

### Pending Todos

None yet.

### Blockers/Concerns

- **RFD900x not purchased.** Procurement is a standing parallel-track action starting now, not gated by software sequencing. Phase 9 cannot start until hardware arrives.
- **Requirement count corrected.** REQUIREMENTS.md originally stated 55 v1 requirements; the actual count is 57. Traceability and coverage figures now reflect 57.
- **Testing season is weeks away.** Phase ordering assumes work may stop at any phase boundary with a usable subset on the car.
